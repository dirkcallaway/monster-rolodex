# Monster Rolodex

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This app allows you to search through various monster cards.  The purpose was to create an app in React to brush up on this frame work.  I added styles and structured to app using multiple components to re-familiarize myself with this framework.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
